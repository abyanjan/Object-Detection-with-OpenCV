# Object-Detection-with-OpenCV

Performing object detection with OpenCV and Deep Learning using pretrained models on coco dataset.

OpenCv's dnn modelule provides easy and fast way to perform object detection with pretrained deep learning modules.

In this repo object detection is performed with two pretrained models on coco dataset:

- MobileNet SSD v3 : The model is downloaded from [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API)
- YoloV3 : The model is downloaded from [here](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
